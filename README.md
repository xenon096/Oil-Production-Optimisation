# Oil-Production-Optimisation
Title:  Production Optimization in Oil Field
Requirements: 
    Using the given production data, design a predictive model that uses historical data from the Volve oil field to forecast daily oil production rates. 
    Your model should take into account factors such as well pressure, temperature, and equipment health. 
    The goal is to optimize production schedules to maximize yield while minimizing downtime and resource waste.
